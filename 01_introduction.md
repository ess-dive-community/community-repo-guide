## Chapter 1 - An brief introduction to GitHub

### Setting up a  GitHub account  
The first step for anyone interested in contributing to the ESS-DIVE GitHub community space is to go to the [GitHub website] and create a GitHub account or sign in if you already have an account.

Then, login and navigate to our ESS-DIVE Community Space on GitHub https://github.com/ess-dive-community

##  Suggesting changes to an existing repository
If you would like to suggest changes to this, or any other repository in our community space, the best way to do so is by submitting a GitHub "issue". When someone submits an issue, the person or team managing the repository is notified, and then developers and the user community can collaborate on steps to solve the issue.   

To submit an issue, first make sure you are logged into your GitHub account. Then, navigate to the repository you would like to submit an issue to. Click the "issue" link toward the top of this repository's page (shown below). If you are having any difficulties accessing a repository or submitting an issue, you can email us at ESS-DIVE support with questions.
