# Template for reporting format Methods Narrative

The methods narrative is part of your final data package upload to ESS-DIVE. It is a short (2-3 paragraph) text document that details your process for developing and gathering feedback on your reporting format.   

Some elements that you might include in your methods narrative are:  

- A couple of opening sentences that provide motivation for creating the reporting format  
- If you created a crosswalk to compare and develop data or metadata element names, how many and which ESS projects were included in the crosswalk? How many elements did you decide to include in the final reporting format based on the comparisons?
- Link to where readers can find the crosswalk on your GitHub page  
- Describe your process for getting feedback from the various ESS projects. Did you conduct interviews? Distribute surveys?
- How many rounds of revision did you ask for feedback on?
- Which projects did you ask to review your reporting format? How many individuals gave you feedback?
- Did you present the draft versions of the reporting format at any meetings, working groups, or webinars.
