# Template for Community Space README files

In this document, you will find our suggested template for creating a GitHub repository README.md file. README files are written in the markdown language and when they are rendered on GitHub or in a GitBook, they are easily readable as a webpage.  This site provide a helpful guide for the type of coding that can be done in markdown: https://commonmark.org/help/

We provide suggestions based on a review that we conducted of 32 GitHub repositories that use GitHub for managing data reporting format documentation.

We have written this document so that you can copy the headings and text below, and replace the text to describe your own reporting format.

---

# Name of your reporting format
Under the name of your reporting format, we suggest you add a short (3 or 4 sentence) overview of the motivation for creating the data reporting format.

---  

## Getting started
The getting started section of your repository is like a table of contents that lists out a concise version of all the documents and information a reader can expect to find in your repository. You do not need to link to every single document in your GitHub repository, but you should link to the most essential documents, so that visitors can access them quickly.

## How to contribute  
Provide details in this section that lets readers know how to suggest modifications to your repository. We recommend that you give a direct link to your [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/ess-dive-community/community-repo-guide/issues). We at ESS-DIVE can also help you set up issue templates, so that when users submit a GitHub issue, they do so in a format you specify. Examples of issue templates can be found [here](https://github.com/ess-dive-community/essdive-file-level-metadata/issues/new/choose)

## About the [reporting format, computer code, tool]

We suggest your README.md file contain a short description of your repository. This can be place either directly under the title of your README file as we wrote the few sentences above or you can write a description under an "About" heading like we have included here. This is also a good place to link out to additional supporting documentation within your repository, or on other websites.

## Copyright information
There are many options for choosing a data use license. GitHub has put together a helpful guide on repository licensing: https://choosealicense.com/ If you eventually upload your repository as a complete data package to ESS-DIVE, the data package will have either a CC BY 4.0 or a CC BY 1.0.

If you need a computer code-specific license, you can explore the BSD license: https://opensource.org/licenses
