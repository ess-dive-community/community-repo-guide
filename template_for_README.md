# Template for Community Space README files

In this document, you will find our suggested template for creating a GitHub repository README.md file. Readme files are written in the markdown language and when they are rendered on GitHub or in a GitBook, they are easily readable as a webpage.  This site provide a helpful guide for the type of coding that can be done in markdown: https://commonmark.org/help/

We provide these suggestions based on a review that we conducted of over a dozen GitHub repositories that use this platform for managing both text-based documents and computer code.

## Getting started
The getting started section of your repository can contain a table of contents listing out all of the content a reader can expect to find in this README file as well as links to other important files within this repository.

> Include details about how to link table of contents?

## How to contribute  
Provide details here to let reader know how to suggest modifications to your repository. We recommend that you give a direct link to your [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/ess-dive-community/community-repo-guide/issues).

## About the [reporting format, computer code, tool]

We suggest your README.md file contain a short description of your repository. This can be place either directly under the title of your README file as we wrote the few sentences above or you can write a description under an "About" heading like I have listed here.

## Copyright information
There are many options for choosing a data use license. GitHub has put together a helpful guide on repository licensing: https://choosealicense.com/ If you eventually upload your repository as a complete data package to ESS-DIVE, the data package will have a CC BY 4.0 license which allows sharing and adaptation as long as users provide attribution.

If you need a computer code-specific license, we recommend looking into the BSD license: https://opensource.org/licenses
