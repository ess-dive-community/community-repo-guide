# Template for Community Space README files

In this document, you will find our suggested template for creating a GitHub repository README.md file. Readme files are written in the markdown language and when they are rendered on GitHub or in a GitBook, they are easily readable as a webpage.  This site provide a helpful guide for the type of coding that can be done in markdown: https://commonmark.org/help/

## How to contribute  
Provide details here to let readers know how to suggest modifications to your repository. We recommend that you give a direct link to your [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/ess-dive-community/community-repo-guide/issues). You may also choose to provide contributing templates, so that when users submit a GitHub issue, they do so in a format you specify.

This is also a good place to link out to supporting documentation that

If you need a computer code-specific license, we recommend looking into the BSD license: https://opensource.org/licenses
