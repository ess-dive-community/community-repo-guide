This is a meta-repository that will help users of the ESS-DIVE community GitHub space become familiar with the typical workflows involved in starting and contributing to repositories in this Community GitHub space.

I've added this line of text in the local copy of the testing branch on my computer.

## The purpose of this repository

The ESS-DIVE GitHub Community Space was started to provide a location where the ESS-DIVE user community can upload documents, codes, and tools related to the [ESS-DIVE repository](http://ess-dive.lbl.gov/). We designed this meta-repository so that ESS-DIVE contributors can familiarize themselves with the process of contributing to an existing ESS-DIVE related GitHub repository or establishing and maintaining a new GitHub repository.

## How to contribute
### Setting up a  GitHub account  
The first step for anyone interested in contributing to the ESS-DIVE GitHub community space is to go to the [GitHub website] and create a GitHub account or sign in if you already have an account.

##  Suggesting changes to an existing repository
If you would like to suggest changes to this, or any other repository on our community page, the best way to do so is by submitting a GitHub "issue "repository to you submit an issue by clicking the "issue" link toward the top of this repository's page. You can also email us at ESS-DIVE support with questions related to this page or to anything else ESS-DIVE related.

## Starting a new repository

All new repositories should be initiated with a README.md file. These files give the reader important context for your GitHub repository. We have compiled a template README.md file which you can view [here](template_for_README.md) .
