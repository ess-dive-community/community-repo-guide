## The purpose of this repository

The ESS-DIVE GitHub Community Space was started to provide a location where the ESS-DIVE user community can upload documents, codes, and tools related to the [ESS-DIVE repository](http://ess-dive.lbl.gov/). We designed this meta-repository so that ESS-DIVE contributors can familiarize themselves with the process of contributing to an existing GitHub repository or starting their own.
